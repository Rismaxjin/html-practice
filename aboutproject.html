  <h1>A deep look at the Japanese manga: HUNTERXHUNTER</h1>
  <p>The chapters of the Hunter × Hunter manga series are written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi and first published by Shueisha in the Japanese magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump. The first chapter was published on March 2, 1998, with subsequent chapters released with intermittent breaks ranging from one to seven weeks. However, starting in February 2006, the breaks increased dramatically in length, after which time a set of at least 10 chapters would be released. For more information, see the production section on the main article.</p>
  <p>Hunters devote themselves to accomplishing hazardous tasks, all from traversing the world's uncharted territories to locating rare items and monsters. Before becoming a Hunter, one must pass the <strong>Examination</strong> —a high-risk selection process in which most applicants end up handicapped or worse, deceased.
    Ambitious participants who challenge the notorious exam carry their own reason. What drives 12-year-old Gon Freecss is finding Ging, his father and a Hunter himself. Believing that he will meet his father by becoming a Hunter, Gon takes the first step to walk the same path.
    During the Hunter Examination, Gon befriends the medical student Leorio Paladiknight, the vindictive Kurapika, and ex-assassin Killua Zoldyck. While their motives vastly differ from each other, they band together for a common goal and begin to venture into a perilous world.

  <h2>Nen</h2>
  <p>Nen (念ネン or ネン, Nen—lit. "Sense"; "Mind Force" in the Viz translation) is one of the defining features of the Hunter × Hunter manga by Yoshihiro Togashi. It's a technique that allows a living being to use and manipulate their own life energy (known as aura); the term "Nen" can also be used in conversation to refer to aura. A person capable of utilizing Nen is colloquially referred to as a "Nen user" (能のう力りょく者しゃ, nōryokusha—lit. "ability person"), while those who cannot go by the designation "non-users" (一いっ般ぱん人じん, ippanjin—lit. "ordinary person").
  Because one can craft a great variety of parapsychological abilities through Nen, it is considered a dangerous power that is kept hidden from the public at large to maintain balance in society.</p><hr>
